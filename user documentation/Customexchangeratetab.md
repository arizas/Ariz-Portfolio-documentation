# Custom Exchange Rates Tab

## General Information:
On this page, you can add your own exchange rates. ArizPortfolio can collect exchange rates from CoinGecko as a basis, but as a user, you are able to manually override this information. Only manually added exchange rates are listed in the overview.

## Explanation:
The list of existing custom exchange rates shows the following information:
1. **Date**: The date of the exchange rate.
2. **Exchange rate**: The specified exchange rate.
3. **Currency**: The currency the rate applies to.
4. **Buy/Sell**: Indicates whether the rate applies when buying NEAR from the selected currency or selling NEAR to the selected currency.
5. **Edit/Delete**: You can edit the exchange rate directly in the table. To delete a rate, click the delete icon next to the relevant entry.

## Example of Use:
- **Adding a new rate**: If you want to add a new rate for EUR, select the date, enter the exchange rate, set the currency to EUR, choose whether the rate applies when buying or selling NEAR, and click "Add custom exchange rate".
- **Editing an existing rate**: To edit an existing rate, simply click on the relevant entry in the table and make the necessary changes.
- **Deleting a rate**: To delete an existing rate, click the delete icon next to the relevant entry.
